05/11/2015 10:49:33 AM - ERROR: Using Xinerama instead of RandR. This option should be avoided at all cost because it does not refresh the list of screens, so you cannot configure displays at runtime. Please check if your driver really does not support RandR and disable this option as soon as you can.
i3: invalid option -- 'X'
Usage: i3 [-c configfile] [-d all] [-a] [-v] [-V] [-C]

	-a          disable autostart ('exec' lines in config)
	-c <file>   use the provided configfile instead
	-C          validate configuration file and exit
	-d all      enable debug output
	-L <file>   path to the serialized layout during restarts
	-v          display version and exit
	-V          enable verbose mode

	--force-xinerama
	Use Xinerama instead of RandR.
	This option should only be used if you are stuck with the
	old nVidia closed source driver (older than 302.17), which does
	not support RandR.

	--get-socketpath
	Retrieve the i3 IPC socket path from X11, print it, then exit.

	--shmlog-size <limit>
	Limits the size of the i3 SHM log to <limit> bytes. Setting this
	to 0 disables SHM logging entirely.
	The default is 0 bytes.

If you pass plain text arguments, i3 will interpret them as a command
to send to a currently running i3 (like i3-msg). This allows you to
use nice and logical commands, such as:

	i3 border none
	i3 floating toggle
	i3 kill window
